/*
First Not Repeating Character

Given a string s consisting of small English letters, find and return the first instance of a non-repeating character in it. If there is no such character, return '_'

Note: Write a solution that only iterates over the string once and uses O(1) additional memory, since this is what you would be asked to do during a real interview.
 
 Guaranteed constraints:
 [input] string s
 
 A string that contains only lowercase English letters.
 1 ≤ s.length ≤ 105.
 
 [output] char
 The first non-repeating character in s, or '_' if there are no characters that do not repeat.
